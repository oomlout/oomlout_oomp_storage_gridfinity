The design should avoid soft shading and instead use sharp angular planes with a limited {color}, making it screen-print friendly. The 3D text should look dynamic and fun, popping forward with strong outlines and a {style} pattern. The background should be plain white with no drop shadows. No gradients, only solid patches of colour. Make the design clean, bold, and eye-catching, with a balance between text and background so the message is clear. Square corners, no border. it must be 3x2 and on a plain white background with no drop shadow'
